  <h3><strong>Objective:</strong></h3>

  <ul>
    <li>I’m seeking an opportunity to be part of a collaborative goal in the success of a
      company’s overall performance and growth in today’s ever advancing operations of
      information technology.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3><strong>Skills Summary:</strong></h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Knowledge of software development cycle, (scrum, agile) infrastructure development,
      production support, automation deployment and configuration services utilizing tools
      such as Kubernetes, Terraform, Ansible, Jenkins, Packer, and Docker. Experience with
      cloud services, (GCP, AWS) Linux/Unix Administration, Python, and Javascript.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3><strong>Previous Projects:</strong></h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Python Project: Writing scripts that interact with the operating system and Gmail API by
      creating a service account in GCP with OAuth 2.0 credentials to send email notifications
      when certain files are created locally.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Terraform Project: Writing Terraform for different cloud architecture projects involving
      standing up highly available microservices. Running multiple workspaces in Terraform
      Cloud for use with different environments. Writing Terraform code that creates files locally
      for my use in personal projects.
    </li>
  </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Cloud Resume Challenge: Building a static website (the one you are
      viewing!) to showcase my resume. I used Terraform to build out all of the
      infrastructure in AWS and I used Github Actions for my CI/CD pipeline.
      New deployments of both the frontend and the backend are triggered when
      code is pushed to the two different repositories. I had fun working
      through this challenge and I definitely learned a lot.
