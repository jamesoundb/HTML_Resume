  <h3><strong>Objective:</strong></h3>

  <p>I’m seeking an opportunity to be part of a collaborative goal in the success of a
    company’s overall performance and growth in today’s ever advancing operations of
    information technology.</p>

  <h3><strong>Skills Summary:</strong></h3>

  <p>Knowledge of software development cycle (scrum, agile), infrastructure development,
    production support, automation deployment and configuration services utilizing tools
    such as Kubernetes, Terraform, Ansible, Jenkins, Packer, and Docker. Experience with
    cloud services, (GCP, AWS) Linux/Unix Administration, Python, and Javascript.</p>

  <h3><strong>Previous Projects:</strong></h3>

  <p>Python Project: Writing scripts that interact with the operating system and Gmail API by
    creating a service account in GCP with OAuth 2.0 credentials to send email notifications
    when certain files are created locally.</p>
  <p>Terraform Project: Writing Terraform for different cloud architecture projects involving
    standing up highly available microservices. Running multiple workspaces in Terraform
    Cloud for use with different environments. Writing Terraform code that creates files locally
    for my use in personal projects.</p>
  <p>
    Cloud Resume Challenge: Building a static website to showcase my resume. I used Terraform to
    build out all of the infrastructure in AWS and I used Github Actions for my CI/CD pipeline. New deployments
    of both the frontend and the backend are triggered when code is pushed to the two different repositories.
