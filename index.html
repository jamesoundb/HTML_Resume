    <h3>Clover, a Fiserv Company | Sunnyvale, CA | Site Reliability Engineer | Oct 2024 – Present</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Platform Engineering & Architecture:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Spearheaded the Kubernetes Platform Abstraction for Vault, designing and implementing a mutating admission webhook in Golang to automate secret injection. This eliminated manual configurations for microservices and established a secure, standardized pattern for secrets management across the platform. These patterns were backported into other features elevating other compositions by taking the hardest composition and applying hard-won design patterns into future development efforts. Combined this forward thinking architecture with Project Onboarding for Crossplane that would accelerate engineering ramp-up for new engineers by several weeks.</li>
          <li>Engineered and configured an Istio Egress Gateway PoC to secure and control outbound traffic for microservices; deployed and configured Kiali to provide deep observability into service mesh traffic patterns, latency, and success rates. Worked with Capeghemi consultants to get this work done and was an effective barrier to other operational teams to this initiative across the finish line. Recognized by his team lead for saving the project after leadership changes removed all others resources on the project.</li>
          <li>Developed and published multiple reusable Terraform modules, including a Kubernetes SQL instance provisioner and a Cloud Function deployment notifier, significantly improving developer experience and standardizing infrastructure patterns.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Automation & Process Improvement:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Pioneered a new infrastructure testing methodology by implementing a Living Proof winning Terraform Mocks framework, leading to more reliable and efficient test cycles; delivered a team-wide presentation on the solution to drive adoption and elevate quality. Turned this work into applied learnings for effective AI System Prompts that were used to guide organization with Gemini and Copilot.</li>
          <li>Contributed to the On-Demand Environments project by automating DNS record creation using Terraform and authoring comprehensive user documentation, enabling teams to self-service provision new environments. Mentored several engineers on effective Terraform module use to meet the change requirements of the on-demand environment initiative.</li>
          <li>Showcased expert level debugging skills using multiple technologies in both production and staging issues, including a persistent Cloud Function deployment bug, incorrect IaC configurations for ProxySQL.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>AI Adoption & Strategic Influence:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Scaled AI adoption across the enterprise, personally mentoring 50+ engineers on the effective, high-ROI use of Gemini and GitHub Copilot.</li>
          <li>Authored foundational documents and created multiple video tutorials for the Clover AI Library, establishing a central repository for best practices that accelerated developer onboarding and proficiency.</li>
          <li>Forged a key strategic relationship with the Fiserv AI Board for my upline, creating a direct channel to champion and enable broader AI integration at the highest levels of the company.</li>
